<p>
This page provides information about data collected from Twitter by Uppsala University for the European Project: “Virt-EU: Values and Ethics in Innovation for Responsible Technology in Europe” (grant agreement No 732027). The personal data we collected are public tweets including the hashtag #IoT (Internet of Things), starting from March 2017, and additional selected hashtags identifying IoT-related interactions, for example hashtags about IoT conferences and other IoT events.

If you would like to access the data we have collected about you, request its removal from our database or opt out from future data collections performed in the context of the Virt-EU project, you can follow the procedure described here: virteu.github.io/userrights.html.

The aim of this research is to empirically identify how local culture and network society influence the understanding and movement of particular social values among technology developers, and how local difference and networked commonalities can influence the development of ethical subjects from an ethical perspective. Empirical data collection and analysis are intended to lay the groundwork for accomplishing the following objectives:
Develop a Privacy, Ethical and Social Impact Assessment (PESIA) framework shaped by state of the art legal research and empirical data, to enable developers and other societal stakeholders to reflect upon, evaluate, and take into account not only the data protection, security and privacy aspects of new technologies but also the ethical and social concerns embedded within that challenge autonomy and freedom.
Systematically co-design with technology developers self-assessment tools and tools supporting ethical discussions in IoT design. As IoT developers may not be able to anticipate the future use of their projects and their clients and partners, we seek to support decision-making with tools grounded in existing developer practices and based on quantitative, case study and design research that identifies how ethics operate as process.

The data controller is Uppsala University, Sweden (http://uu.se). The controller’s representative for the Virt-EU project is Dr. Matteo Magnani (matteo.magnani@it.uu.se). The data protection officer can be contacted at Dataskyddsombud@uu.se.

The purposes of the processing are: (1) to compute statistics about the structure and content of online interactions about the IoT, (2) to use them to characterize the Internet of Things as a concept, for example by following the temporal evolution of the main topics discussed in this area, (3) to identify prominent participants in the discussion, as an input to qualitative researchers for further investigation.
</p>
<p>
The legal basis for the processing is public interest; the processing is performed by a public University to complete a research study funded by the European Union.
</p>
<p>
The collected data is stored in a password-protected database server, and accessible in read-only mode by the members of the Virt-EU research consortium, through a password-protected Web interface. Only the data controller has full access to the data (including update and deletion).
</p>
<p>
The collected personal data will be stored at least until the end of the project (January 2020), or later in case not all the analyses necessary for the purposes described above have been performed.

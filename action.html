<h1>REQUESTS FROM DATA SUBJECTS</h1>

<p>
As a data subject, you can request one of the following actions, that will be evaluated based on its impact on the research study:
<ul>
<li>Get the tweets produced by you that we have stored in our database.</li>
<li>Request the removal of (some of) the tweets produced by you that we have stored in our database.</li>
<li>Opt out from this research, that is, disallow us from storing tweets produced by you in our database from now on,
in the context of this research project.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you want to do so, you have to:
<ol>
<li>Follow the Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/eu_virt">@eu_virt</a> using the Twitter user whose data has been collected (this is needed to make sure that the request comes from you).</li>
<li>If you want to receive a copy of all the tweets produced by you that we have stored in our database: send a private message to the @eu_virt account writing "Get"</li>
<li>If you want  to request the removal of the tweets produced by you that we have stored in our database: send a private message to the @eu_virt account writing "Remove"</li>
<li>If you want  us not to store tweets produced by you from now on, but you allow us to keep the tweets we have collected so far, send a private message to the @eu_virt account writing "Opt out"</li>
</ol>
</p>

You will then be notified about the receipt and processing status of the request, and can at that point unfollow the Twitter account.
